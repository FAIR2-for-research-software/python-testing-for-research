# Python testing for research

A short course on the basics of software testing in Python using the `pytest` library.

This lesson uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench] template.

## Course Description

Whether you are a seasoned developer or just write the occasional script, it's important to know that your code does what you intend, and will continue to do so as you make changes.

Software testing is a methodology of automatically ensuring that your code works correctly, without having to go back and manually verify after each change.

This course seeks to provide you with conceptual understanding and the tools you need to start ensuring the robustness of your code.
