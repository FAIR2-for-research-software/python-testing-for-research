:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How do you write a lesson using R Markdown and `{sandpaper}`?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain how to use markdown with the new lesson template
- Demonstrate how to include pieces of code, figures, and nested challenge blocks

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

As we saw in the previous lesson, you can invoke pytest using the `pytest` terminal command.
This searches within the current directory for files that start or end with 'test'. For example:
`test_scripts.py`, `scripts_test.py`. It then searches for tests in these files, which are functions
(or classes) with names start with 'test', such as the `test_add` function we made in the previous lesson.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

## Challenge 1: Run pytest on several test files at once

- Step 1: Create a folder called `interacting_with_tests`
- Step 2: Create a file in that folder called called `test_adding.py`
- Step 3: Add the following test to `test_adding.py`:

```python
def test_add(a, b):
   assert add(5, 3) == 8
   assert add(0, 5) == 5
   assert add(-8, 4) == 4
   assert add(-2, -2) == -4
```

- Step 4: Create another file called `test_subtracting.py`:
- Step 5: Add the followign test to `test_subtracting.py`:

```python
def test_subtract(a, b)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Inline instructor notes can help inform instructors of timing challenges
associated with the lessons. They appear in the "Instructor View"

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?

What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "lesson", "looks", "good")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Output
 
```output
[1] "This new lesson looks good"
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Figures

You can include figures generated from R Markdown:

```{r pyramid, fig.alt = "pie chart illusion of a pyramid", fig.cap = "Sun arise each and every morning"}
pie(
  c(Sky = 78, "Sunny side of pyramid" = 17, "Shady side of pyramid" = 5), 
  init.angle = 315, 
  col = c("deepskyblue", "yellow", "yellow3"), 
  border = FALSE
)
```
Or you can use pandoc markdown for static figures with the following syntax:

`![optional caption that appears below the figure](figure url){alt='alt text for
accessibility purposes'}`

## Math

One of our episodes contains $\LaTeX$ equations when describing how to create
dynamic reports with {knitr}, so we now use mathjax to describe this:

`$\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$` becomes: $\alpha = \dfrac{1}{(1 - \beta)^2}$

Cool, right?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
