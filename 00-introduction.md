## Welcome to Testing and Continuous Integration with Python

This course aims to equip researchers with the skills to write effective tests and ensure the quality and reliability of their research software. No prior testing experience is required! We'll guide you through the fundamentals of software testing using Python's Pytest framework, a powerful and beginner-friendly tool. You'll also learn how to integrate automated testing into your development workflow using continuous integration (CI). CI streamlines your process by automatically running tests with every code change, catching bugs early and saving you time. By the end of the course, you'll be able to write clear tests, leverage CI for efficient development, and ultimately strengthen the foundation of your scientific findings.

This course has a single continuous project that you will work on throughout the lessons and each lesson builds on the last through practicals that will help you apply the concepts you learn. However if you get stuck or fall behind during the course, don't worry!
All the stages of the project for each lesson are available in the `files` directory in this course's materials that you can copy across if needed. For example if you are on lesson 3 and haven't completed the practicals for lesson 2, you can copy the corresponding folder from the `files` directory.

By the end of this course, you should:

- Understand how testing can be used to improve code & research reliability
- Be comfortable with writing basic tests & running them
- Be able to construct a simple Python project that incorporates tests
- Be familiar with testing best practices such as unit testing & the AAA pattern 
- Be aware of more advanced testing features such as fixtures & parametrization
- Understand what Continuous Integration is and why it is useful
- Be able to add testing to a GitHub repository with simple Continuous Integration
